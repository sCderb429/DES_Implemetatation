To_Do DES Implementation

Take Hexadecimal Input
Take every two digits of hex and Convert all sets of two into binary
Take binary and compare it to the first table, which simple consists of 64 bits from 1 to 64
This first table shows the location on the second table that the binary should go to
    The second table splits even and odd ints, with the even on the left half and the odd on the right

The table is formed by adding all the digits from 1 to 64 in binary array and making it
transform into the other array; just move the digits
